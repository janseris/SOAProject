run prometheus.exe in prometheus folder
- it reads the prometheus.yml settings file

- then we can access it on http://localhost:9090/
- we can check if it can access our application on http://localhost:9090/targets

- when prometheus is running, grafana can display data which it collects
- prometheus collects data from /metrics endpoint from our application



app metrics -> prometheus -> grafana
